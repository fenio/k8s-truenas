## k8s + TrueNAS Scale using democratic-csi

[democratic-csi](https://github.com/democratic-csi/democratic-csi) based simple guide to use Kubernetes cluster with TrueNAS Scale over API. 

You can use democratic-csi documentation and achieve the same results but the reason I created this 
guide is the fact that democratic-csi docs are covering multiple awkward combinations of various 
technologies and if you just want to have NFS/iSCSI over API then the whole setup guide can be much simpler.

### Prerequisities
You're here cause you want to connect Kubernetes cluster to TrueNAS Scale based NAS right?
So you need:
* k8s cluster - in my case deployed using [kubespray](https://kubespray.io) but it shouldn't really matter what you use to create it.
* NAS based on TrueNAS Scale - in my case it's [ugly-nas](https://github.com/fenio/ugly-nas) 

## Preparations

* Nodes section needs to be run on nodes of your cluster, preferably Debian based
* NAS section needs to be done on your NAS and assumption is that this is TrueNAS Scale based solution
* K8S section needs to be run on whatever machine you're using to manage your cluster

### Nodes
All your nodes should be capable of using NFS/iSCSI shares. It means that some extra packages need to be installed 
on them. In my case it's being handled by [dumb-provisioner](https://github.com/fenio/dumb-provisioner) 
which takes care of installing my terminals but in general you just have to run this on every node:

```
# apt install nfs-common open-iscsi multipath-tools scsitools lsscsi
# cat <<EOF > /etc/multipath.conf
defaults {
    user_friendly_names yes
    find_multipaths yes
}
EOF
```

Hash at the beginning of lines means you have to run them as root. So in case you're on Ubuntu just add sudo in front of these commands.
In case of Fedora/RedHat based systems something like that should also work:

```
# dnf install -y lsscsi iscsi-initiator-utils sg3_utils device-mapper-multipath
```

### NAS 

## Let's start with creating API key

![API](api.png)
Need to make screenshots.

![API2](api.gif)
Gif test

### K8S
Let's start with adding repo.

```
helm repo add democratic-csi https://democratic-csi.github.io/charts/
helm repo update
```

Again above is simplified/streamlined version of values file. Below is the command to get file with comments.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/democratic-csi/charts/master/stable/democratic-csi/examples/freenas-iscsi.yaml -O - | sed '/INLINE/,$d' > iscsi.yaml
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/democratic-csi/democratic-csi/master/examples/freenas-api-iscsi.yaml -O - | sed -e 's/^/    /g' >> iscsi.yaml
```

Once you've got your files you can install democratic-csi like this:


```
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --values nfs.yaml --namespace storage nfs democratic-csi/democratic-csi
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace --values iscsi.yaml --namespace storage iscsi democratic-csi/democratic-csi
```
